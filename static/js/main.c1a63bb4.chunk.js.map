a leadership role for a cultural RSO at UNL called the Vietnamese Student Association (VSA). VSA\r\n        is student organization with the mission to promote, preserve, and educate students on campus about Vietnamese culture.\r\n        We aim to create an environment where Vietnamese and Vietnamese American students can come and find a place on campus to meet new friends\r\n        and find leadership opportunities.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <div style={{ textAlign:\"center\" }}>\r\n        <img src={vsa_gbm} align=\"center\" alt=\"description\"/>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <Typography variant=\"h6\" color=\"textSecondary\" paragraph>\r\n        With my role this year, I am the internal vice president. What my important tasks are throughout the year is that I plan with my team of 3\r\n        to plan our general body meetings with the goal of having at least 2 meetings each month. To reach that goal, this requires us to plan far ahead\r\n        since we need time to brainstorm what topic we want to do, research the topic, and then plan the activity so that our members can stay \r\n        engaged throughout the meeting.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <Typography variant=\"h6\" color=\"textSecondary\" paragraph>\r\n        What I have learned and gained from this experience is the ability to speak and give presentations to my peers. It has helped me get prepared\r\n        and fix my stutter for when I give presentations. Although my presentations skills are still not perfect, it is still a step in the right direction.\r\n        Through these meetings, I have been able to hone these skills which will help me lead meetings for when I am out in my career as a software engineer.\r\n        It will be important to have these skills, when I am demonstrating a new piece of software to the person who is in charge of me, and explain things\r\n        in a way where it makes sense.\r\n      </Typography>      \r\n      <div style={{ textAlign:\"center\" }}>\r\n        <img src={vsa_folk} align=\"center\" alt=\"description\"/>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <Typography variant=\"h6\" color=\"textSecondary\" paragraph>\r\n        Along with my leadership role, I was fortunate enough to be enrolled in a class that can help me develop my leadership skills. I was able\r\n        to take UHON 201H: Leadership in Action. Through this class I was able to attend a workshop that helped me learn a various amount of techniques\r\n        from the instructor and from my peers on how I can be more inclusive to the community around me. Some of these techniques that I have incorporated into\r\n        my leadership role in my RSO is that I incorporated ice breakers that allowed people to be active and discuss with each other. The picture above showcases\r\n        one of our general body meetings incorprating some of the things that I learned from my peers in the workshops.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n    </Container>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default VSA;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { Typography, Grid, Container, Button } from '@material-ui/core';\r\n\r\nconst Home = () =>{\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <Container maxWidth=\"sm\">\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h2\" align=\"center\" color=\"textPrimary\" gutterBottom>\r\n          Hello!\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <Typography variant=\"h6\" align=\"center\" color=\"textSecondary\" paragraph>\r\n          I am Viet Ninh, and I am a software engineer\r\n        </Typography>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <Grid container spacing={2} justifyContent='center'>\r\n            <Grid item>\r\n              <Button variant=\"contained\" href='tel:4027709505'>\r\n                Call Me\r\n              </Button>\r\n            </Grid>\r\n            <Grid item>\r\n              <Button variant=\"outlined\" color=\"primary\" href='mailto:vietquocninh@gmail.com'>\r\n                Email Me\r\n              </Button>\r\n            </Grid>\r\n          </Grid>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </Container>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Home;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { Typography, Container } from '@material-ui/core';\r\nimport thingiverse_image from './static/research_images/thingiverse_image.png'\r\nimport model_image from './static/research_images/prusaslicer-base.JPG'\r\nconst VSA = () =>{\r\n  return (\r\n    <Container maxWidth=\"med\">\r\n      <Typography variant=\"h3\" align=\"center\" color=\"textPrimary\" gutterBottom>\r\n        My Research Experience\r\n        </Typography>\r\n      <div style={{ textAlign:\"center\" }}>\r\n        <img src={model_image} align=\"center\" alt=\"description\" height=\"200\"/>\r\n      <Typography>\r\n          This image showcases an image of a 3D model that I was able to find with an intentional void.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <br/>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <Typography variant=\"h6\" color=\"textSecondary\" paragraph>\r\n        The research that I was helping conduct was finding data on 3D models that have hollow spaces, or voids, inside of them. The reason why we needed\r\n        to find these 3D models was to be able to gather data on models that have intentional voids inside of them and determine that they are safe and intentional voids.\r\n        This research is necessary because as 3D printing becomes more and more relevant, users would need a way to guarantee that the 3D model that they will be printing\r\n        will be the model that they intend.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <br/>\r\n      <div style={{ textAlign:\"center\" }}>\r\n        <img src={thingiverse_image} align=\"center\" alt=\"description\"/>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <Typography variant=\"h6\" color=\"textSecondary\" paragraph>\r\n        With my role, I was tasked with downloading models off of a website called Thingiverse. This is a public website where users would be able to\r\n        upload their 3D models for the public to enjoy and use for themselves. I built a python script to scrape those sites and download as many 3D models as we can.\r\n        I then run an analysis on those models and collect the models that have voids inside of them. Through this research, I was able to develop skills in web scraping\r\n        and managed to grasp a better understanding on how important a security signature on a file is.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <Typography variant=\"h6\" color=\"textSecondary\" paragraph>\r\n        With my python script, I used a python package called Selenium. What Selenium does is that it is able to mimic a web browser. This allows me to mimic a page on Thingiverse\r\n        and grab all of the files that appear at the head page. My python script then checks if that file has already been downloaded, and will skip it.\r\n        With the specific 3D model file type we are looking for is stl files, I would extract all of the stl files from each item in thingiverse. From there\r\n        I will run an analysis on all of those models, and from the analysis results. I am able to tell and determine which file has a void or hollow space inside of it.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <div style={{ textAlign:\"center\" }}>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </Container>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default VSA;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { Typography, Container } from '@material-ui/core';\r\nimport building from './static/research_images/3D-printed-building-Dubai.jpg'\r\nconst Opportunity = () => {\r\n  return(\r\n    <Container>\r\n      <Typography variant=\"h3\" align=\"center\" gutterBottom>\r\n        My Research Opportunity\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <Typography variant=\"h6\" color=\"textSecondary\" paragraph>\r\n        At the beginning of my senior year, I was determined of going into graduate school. I never really thought about going into graduate\r\n        until the summer after my junior year in 2023. This was mainly due to my school, the University of Nebraska Lincoln, establishing the\r\n        accelerated program for software engineering students to receive a masters degree in computer science with only one additional year after\r\n        I graduate with my masters. This was an opportunity that I believed to be extremely valuable, not only for my career, but for myself as \r\n        a student as well because, while I am still young, I will have the capacity to continue on learning at an accelerated rate.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <div style={{ textAlign:\"center\" }}>\r\n        <img src={building} align=\"center\" height=\"250\" alt=\"3D printed building in Dubai\"/>\r\n        <Typography>\r\n          This image showcases an image of a building that was 3D printed.

I contacted Dr. Sris-an from the School of Computing on whether he was in charge of any research projects\r\n        and luckily enough he did, and that he was looking for undergraduate to help him on the tasks. Dr. Srisa-an's research team is working on a\r\n        solution to detect malicious or bad 3D model files. What causes is this problem is that, malicious people on the internet go around and inject\r\n        what is known as voids or hollow spaces inside of 3D models that would be used for 3D printing. What those spaces inside of the models cause is\r\n        that the object, when 3D printed, becomes fragile and its durability gets worse. This is a problem because as 3D printing is becoming\r\n        more important it becomes essential to standard users to know that the file that they will be handling is safe.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <Typography variant=\"h6\" color=\"textSecondary\" paragraph>\r\n        My task for this project is to collect 3D models from the internet to find 3D models with voids or hollow spaces inside of the model.\r\n        The goal of this task is to be able to find 3D models whose voids are intentional and that they are good for the model. With the data from the models,\r\n        we will be able to create a program that would be able to determine whether a model with a void or space inside of it is intentional or not.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n    </Container>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Opportunity;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { Typography, Container } from '@material-ui/core';\r\n\r\nconst Takeaway = () => {\r\n  return(\r\n    <Container>\r\n      <Typography variant=\"h3\" align=\"center\" gutterBottom>\r\n        My Research Takeaways\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <Typography variant=\"h6\" color=\"textSecondary\" paragraph>\r\n        Through this research opportunity, I was able to takeaway many different skills and different perspectives to 3D models and their security.\r\n        The first skill that I was able to takeaway from this first semester was the versatility of the Selenium python package. This package was\r\n        extremely useful in website scraping data, and I can see myself using this for the future to collect data whenever I would need it in the future.\r\n        Another takeaway from this project was the importance of security of 3D models and that they are safe to use. This makes me realize that no matter\r\n        how small a file can be, ensuring that it is a safe file is important no matter what the file is used for. Ensuring the file will ensure that\r\n        a process will be finished as it is intended to work as.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n      <Typography variant=\"h6\" color=\"textSecondary\" paragraph>\r\n        Being able to research on the security of 3D model files has made me want to study more about cybersecurity. I think that cyber security is important\r\n        for our future because as the internet and technology become more and more prevalent, I believe that the importance of the files and data that we use and \r\n        send across the internet is secure and used in a safe manner. Being able to work on this project, provided me with more insight on one aspect of cybersecurity\r\n        and I cannot wait to see how much more I learn in the throughout my spring semester.\r\n      </Typography>\r\n    </Container>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Takeaway;","import React, { useState } from 'react';\r\nimport { HashRouter as Router, Route, Routes, Link} from 'react-router-dom';\r\nimport { Typography, AppBar,CssBaseline, Toolbar, Container, Button, Avatar, Menu, MenuItem } from '@material-ui/core';\r\n\r\nimport useStyles from './css/App';\r\n\r\nimport profile from \"./static/images/profile.jpg\";\r\n\r\nimport VSA from './VSA';\r\nimport Home from './Home';\r\nimport Research from './Research';\r\nimport Opportunity from './Opportunity';\r\nimport Takeaway from './Takeaway';\r\n\r\nconst App = () => {\r\n  const classes = useStyles();\r\n\r\n  const [anchorEl, setAnchorEl] = useState(null);\r\n  \r\n  const handleClick = (event) => {\r\n    setAnchorEl(event.currentTarget);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const handleClose = () => {\r\n    setAnchorEl(null);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const handleMenuItemClick = () => {\r\n    handleClose();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <Router>\r\n      <CssBaseline />\r\n      <Container>\r\n      <AppBar className={classes.navbar}>\r\n      <Toolbar>\r\n        <Avatar alt=\"Viet Ninh\" src={profile} sx={{width: 56, height: 56}}/>\r\n        <Typography variant='h6' style={{padding: \"10px\"}}>\r\n          Viet Ninh\r\n        </Typography>\r\n\r\n        <Button variant=\"contained\" component={Link} to=\"/\" style={{ margin: '8px 8px 8px 8px' }}>\r\n          Home\r\n        </Button>\r\n        <Button variant=\"contained\" component={Link} to=\"/vsa\" style={{ margin: '8px 8px 8px 8px' }}>\r\n          Leadership Experience\r\n        </Button>\r\n\r\n        <div>\r\n          <Button variant=\"contained\" onClick={handleClick} style={{ margin: '8px 8px 8px 8px' }}>\r\n            Research Menu\r\n          </Button>\r\n          <Menu anchorEl={anchorEl} open={Boolean(anchorEl)} onClose={handleClose}>\r\n            <MenuItem onClick={() => handleMenuItemClick()} component={Link} to=\"/opportunity\">\r\n              Research Opportunity\r\n            </MenuItem>\r\n            <MenuItem onClick={() => handleMenuItemClick()} component={Link} to=\"/research\">\r\n              Research Experience\r\n            </MenuItem>\r\n            <MenuItem onClick={() => handleMenuItemClick()} component={Link} to=\"/takeaway\">\r\n              Research Takeaway\r\n            </MenuItem>\r\n          </Menu>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </Toolbar>\r\n    </AppBar>\r\n        <main>\r\n          {/* Navigation Links */}\r\n          <div>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            {/* Routing */}\r\n            <Routes>\r\n              <Route path=\"/takeaway\" element={<Takeaway />} />\r\n              <Route path=\"/opportunity\" element={<Opportunity />} />\r\n              <Route path=\"/research\" element={<Research />} />\r\n              <Route path=\"/vsa\" element={<VSA />} />\r\n              <Route path=\"/\" element={<Home />} />\r\n            </Routes>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </main>\r\n      </Container>\r\n    </Router>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\nexport default App;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\r\nimport App from './App';\r\n\r\nconst domNode = document.getElementById('root');\r\nconst root = createRoot(domNode);\r\nroot.render(\r\n              <App/>\r\n            );"],"sourceRoot":""}
